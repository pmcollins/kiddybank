# kiddybank

This is a iOS app for allowance management and simple parental banking I wrote a few years ago. It was on the app store for a
couple of years before iOS 7 came out with its flat design and broke the UI. I ended up pulling the app and attempting several
abortive rewrites, including a port to Swift.
