# KiddyBank

This is an iOS app I wrote a few years ago for allowance management and simple parental 'banking'. It was on the app store
for a couple of years before iOS 7 came out, which came with lots of incompatible UI changes. I ended up pulling the app
and attempting several abortive rewrites, including a port to Swift.
